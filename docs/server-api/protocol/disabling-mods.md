# ðŸ›‘ Disabling Mods

The VirtualClient listens for packets on the `"virtualclient:serverapi"` channel as described [here](getting-started/#messaging). The packet for Disabling Mods has the identifier `"disable-mods"`.

## Payload

The payload of the disable-mods packet looks like this:

```json
{
    "clear": false, //Optional - Clears the disabled-mods list
    "blockMods": ["fps"], //Optional - List of mods to block
    "unblockMods": ["zoom"] //Optional - List of mods to un-block
}
```
