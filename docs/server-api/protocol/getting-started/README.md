### Messaging

The client communicates with the server over one **custom payload channel**. Spigot and some other  server APIs call them **plugin channels**.&#x20;

The message channel you want to listen and send to is: `"virtualclient:serverapi"`

### Packet Structure

VirtualClient Server-API Packets are sent in JSON form.

```json
{
    "identifier": "example",
    "payload": {
        //data
    }
}
```

The identifier declares what the packet is for, and the payload contains the actual data of the packet.

## Communicating with the Client

We have provided helper classes to communicate with the client. You can write these classes yourself if you want to, of course.

In the next step, you will learn how to detect if a player is using the VirtualClient.
