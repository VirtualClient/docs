# Introduction

The VirtualClient Server-API allows you to customize how the VirtualClient works on your minecraft server. To get started, you should know what you want to do.



If you are a developer and want a basic and ready to use API, you can use our [server-api](server-api/plugin).

If you are a developer and don't want to use an external API check out our [protocol docs](protocol/protocol/getting-started/).

If you are a server administrator and want an easily configurable plugin, check out our spigot-plugin here.
